## Installation & Configuration

### Step 1
Install [ESPHome][esphome] by following this guide: https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html.

### Step 2
Copy the Folder `ESPHome` into `/config/` from HomeAssistant. Next you have to add the code in the following files into your HomeAssistant configuration: `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `input_boolean.yaml`, `input_select.yaml` and `input_text.yaml`.

### Step 3
Now adjust the `esp32 doorbell.yaml` via the ESPHome editor. Do that also with your other configuration files.

### Step 4
Now you¬¥re ready to flash. Now you have to click on `validate` and if you got "esp32 doorbell.yaml is valid üëç" you can flash the ESP32 camera module via an FTDI USB flash adapter. If your configuration fails, check it again, fix the error and flash it.

### Step 5
Now check the serial console of the ESPHome flasher tool and wait for the module to successfully connect to the wifi. Next you have to go to the integrations page in HomeAssistand and add the ESPHome flashed chip via its ip address you saw in the serial console of the `ESPHome flasher`.

### Step 6
Restart HomeAssistant and you¬¥re ready to test it.
